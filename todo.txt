## To be implemented

As smart user I want to compare an open database with another to know which is
the most recent version

- table with continuous history/ audit-table?
- output/ display?

As smart user I want to import/ merge another database into the currently
opened to make it the most recent version

## Backlog/ Various
- employer assignment view
- timeline of technology
- perl interface, export XML
- wiki, i18n part of table, standalone without translation resources=personal
  table

# Done

## User Stories

- search in capabilities/ filter tree
- en, will not break current upgrade.sh, as it filters by locale-specific
  upgrade.lst
- capability view, grouped by name, joined with category
- skill views, capabilities with skills and without
- additional capabilities, project management
- skill table, FK to cap_capability
- schemaspy-figures/ howto
- fill app_capability from install scripts
- upgrade script, determine max version from app_capability and enumerate
  upgrade-scripts until max file name
- role table, JOIN-table to cap_project,
- Tool-Recommendation, sqlitestudio, sqlitebrowser

# Fixed

## Entity Actions not disabled while no Database open

1. Do not open a database upon startup or close an open database
1. Pick any view that creates entities, e.g. Company
1. Click New & fill in form
1. Finish with Ok
1. Exception occurs

Instead all actions on all entity views must be disabled when no database is
open.


# Rejected

- app_capability with prepare-entry per version, upon start of upgrade this
  entry is created and fails, if it already exists with
  unique-constraint=safety check â€“ upgrade.sh takes care
