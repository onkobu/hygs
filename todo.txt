  upgrade.lst
- capability view, grouped by name, joined with category
- skill views, capabilities with skills and without
- additional capabilities, project management
- skill table, FK to cap_capability
- schemaspy-figures/ howto

- upgrade script, determine max version from app_capability and enumerate
  upgrade-scripts until max file name
- role table, JOIN-table to cap_project,

# Rejected

- app_capability with prepare-entry per version, upon start of upgrade this
  entry is created and fails, if it already exists with
  unique-constraint=safety check – upgrade.sh takes care
